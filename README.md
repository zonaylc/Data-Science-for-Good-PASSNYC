### Dataset
This dataset is collected from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good), provided by PASSNYC which is a non-for-profit organization that facilitates a collective impact that is dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City's talented and underserved students. And the dataset is a public data used to identify students within New York Cityâ€™s under-performing school districts. PASSNYC aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) through consulting and collaboration with partners. By focusing efforts in under-performing areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, it might help to pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.
